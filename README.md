Litmus tests
---

This repo is a collection of small utilities I made to help myself in the past. They were so small and self contained that they became good exercises to see if I understood some core concepts of a programing language. So they became my "litmus tests".

* time2secs - Clock time conversion to seconds

* hex - hex <-> int number converter

* stripper - Strip extra whitespace from files

* sloc - Count source lines of codes in one or many files
