time2sex
========

A command line utility to convert standard time (HH:MM:SS) into seconds.

Why?
====

A while ago I was playing Minesweeper and the client I was using displayed time in an MM:SS format, and I preferred seconds only, so I made this. time2sex has since become a litmus test to see if I understand the basics of a new programming language or not.
