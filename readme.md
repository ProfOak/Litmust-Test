time2sex
========

A command line utility to convert standard time (HH:MM:SS) into seconds

Why?
====

A while ago I was playing Minesweeper and the client I was using displayed time in an MM:SS format, and I preferred seconds only, so I made this. After I made a version in python I challenged myself to use my beginner C skills and come up with a C solution.

**Usage:**


Python
------

`$ ./time2sex.py 12:34:56`

`=== 45296 seconds ===`

C
-

`$ ./time2sex 12:34:56`

`=== 45296 seconds ===`
