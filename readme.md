time2sex
========

A command line utility to convert standard time (HH:MM:SS) into seconds

Why?
====

A while ago I was playing Minesweeper and the client I was using displayed time in an MM:SS format, and I preferred seconds only, so I made this

**Usage:**

`$ ./time2sex.py 12:34:56`

`=== 45296 seconds ===`
